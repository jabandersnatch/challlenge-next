# Project Details
The project uses Next.js 13 with the beta 'app' directory, and Typescript.
The project includes two routes in addition to the home route.
Firebase is used for authentication and data persistence.
The design patterns used include Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) and Data Access Object (DAO).
Authentication, Server-side Rendering (SSR), and Client-side Rendering (CSR) are all implemented, SPA with client-side routing, Componet-based, Progressive Web App (PWA).
In order to test the authentication features, you need to register and login using the navbar at the top of the app. Once you register, you are automatically logged in.
